# Get Started with NERSC

## Get an Account
To get started with NERSC, you need to have an account.
Before you request an account, you need to know which project
you are going to work on and use the project ID to request an account.
[Here](https://docs.nersc.gov/accounts/#how-to-get-a-new-user-account-in-an-existing-projectrepository) 
is the link for new NERSC users.

## Access NERSC
Highly recommend to setup the [sshproxy](https://docs.nersc.gov/connect/mfa/#sshproxy) 
to access NERSC. 
With the sshproxy, you only need to type the password + MFA code once per 24 hours.

Once setup the sshproxy, download the [VSCode]()
and follow the [NERSC instructions](https://docs.nersc.gov/connect/nersc-connect/#visual-studio-code)
 about using VSCdoe to connect to NERSC.

Another way to connect to NERSC is through the [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.nersc.gov/).
